        <p>Emperor penguins hunt for fish and other marine life in the open seas or in cracks in the ice. They can dive to depths of almost 550 metres (1800 feet), staying underwater for almost 20 minutes at a time. To withstand the cold, emperor penguins reduce their metabolism and blood flow to non-essential organs. And to deal with water pressure during dives, penguins have evolved solid bones as opposed to the hollow ones common among flying birds.
